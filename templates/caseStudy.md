## Part 2 
Case study: Find a software/lib that uses the testing tool

Mozilla Firefox has used american fuzzy lop multiple times. [Here](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1045977) is a bug example.

* **Q2.1. What is the purpose of the sw/lib, i.e. what does it aim to do for users/developers?** Mozilla Firefox is a free and open-source web browser developed by The Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, Mozilla Corporation. 

* **Q2.2. What are the key technologies used to develop the lib?** 
  - Rendering engine: Gecko, C++ 
  - JavaScript engine: SpiderMonkey, C 
  - UI: Mostly XUL (a custom XML dialect), CSS, and JavaScript, with some C++.

* **Q2.3. What kind of automated testing tools are used to test the sw/lib (including but possible more than YTT) and what are their key features?**

* **Q2.4. Which features of the automated testing tools are currently used by the test suite?**

* **Q2.5. Which features of the automated testing tools are NOT used by the test suite?**

## Part 3 
Interview developers/testers of YTT

* **Q3.1. Reach out to the developers of YTT and ask them about their reasons for developing YTT. Why this particular type of testing technology? Which situations is it good for and less good for?** Waiting for an answer. I sent an email to research_requests@mozilla.com :email:

* **Q3.2 Ask them how mature they think YTT is? Is it suitable for use by companies developing real-world software at scale? Why / why not?** Waiting for an answer. I sent an email to research_requests@mozilla.com :email:

* **Q3.3. Ask them how they plan to evolve and develop YTT going forward. What are the main improvements needed to take the tool to the next level?** Waiting for an answer. I sent an email to research_requests@mozilla.com :email:
