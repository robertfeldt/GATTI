## Part 2 Case study - Find a software/lib that uses the testing tool
* Q2.1. What is the purpose of the sw/lib, i.e. what does it aim to do for users/developers?

* Q2.2. What are the key technologies used to develop the lib?

* Q2.3. What kind of automated testing tools are used to test the sw/lib (including but possible more than YTT) and what are their key features?

* Q2.4. Which features of the automated testing tools are currently used by the test suite?

* Q2.5. Which features of the automated testing tools are NOT used by the test suite?

## Part 3 Interview developers/testers of YTT
* Q3.1. Reach out to the developers of YTT and ask them about their reasons for developing YTT. Why this particular type of testing technology? Which situations is it good for and less good for?

* Q3.2 Ask them how mature they think YTT is? Is it suitable for use by companies developing real-world software at scale? Why / why not?

* Q3.3. Ask them how they plan to evolve and develop YTT going forward. What are the main improvements needed to take the tool to the next level?
