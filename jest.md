# [Jest] (https://jestjs.io)

 
 Jest is a JavaScript testing framework maintained by Facebook. Most large companies and applications that work with Javascript (including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, NYTimes, Oculus, Airbnb, and more)
 Jest is actually a testing framework and not just a library. This means it comes with a test runner, assertion library, and support for things like mocking. 

**Testing Approach:** 
JEST is a framework to produce automated Test for Javascript application

**Testing Level:** 
Jest is designed for unit testing of all kind. Example: Snapshot comparison, Function testing, DOM testing.

**Target application domain:** 
The testing tool targets all Javascript project.

## Features

- Snapshot Testin
- Async testing
- Mocks
- Code coverage
- Exceptions

## Pros

- Zero configuration
- Snapshot testing
- Isolated test
- Great API with an entire toolkit

## Cons

- Less tooling and library support than competitors
- Cross dependency
- Slow due to auto mocking

## Required information / models

The tester will have to provide a javascript file with the extension .test and nothing else since Jest is a node-based test runner. Running npm test in a Terminal window within your app directory will initialize Jest and start testing in watch mode — meaning changes to files will re-run the tests associated with those files immediately as you are developing.

## Target platform and dependencies

All Javascript application can use this testing Framework. It's a misbelief to think that the framework is only for React applications.

**Dependencies:** 

- Jest needs Babel 
- NodeJs

## Updates

There is at least one commit per day on the Jest Github. That means that the community around this tool developped by Facebook is taking care to update and maintained the tool. With now 163 releases over the years we can say that Jest is well maintained.

**Latest update:** 

- April 4 2019

**First release date:** 

- May 14 2015

## Licensing / Cost

Jest has an MIT license that you can find on GITHUB and the software  is totally free

## Tutorials and documentation

Documentation :
    This doc is to get started with Jest you will find all the basic steps to download and use Jest

Tutorial: 
    This tutorial is building a small react application to try the basic features of Jest

## Usage examples

I find it interesting to look at open source projects on GitHub that were created by Facebook to show examples of Jest since it was also developed by Facebook. So the examples can reflect the good ways to use Jest.

Both project use Jest for Unit testing

## Alternative tools

These three tools have the same goal as Jest but achieve it with some differences depending on the software

Mocha - https://mochajs.org/ 
Jasmine - https://jasmine.github.io/
Enzyme - https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme
