# Case study

Koodoo, a company who "[..]combine state-of-the-art technology with a deep understanding of the mortgage industry to rapidly scale digital mortgage offerings", once used tools such as Cucumber and Specflow but came to a point where these tools were not satisfying their needs.

>Let’s face it: there is a need for BDD frameworks to evolve with the times and most of them aren’t doing that.
This is where we began soul searching. We were looking for a BDD framework that kept the core values of BDD intact,
whilst respecting the need for enhanced automation support. After some research, reading and many youtube videos later, we hit gold.
Drum roll…… We found Gauge"

This became a dilemma for Koodoo as they were already well-integrated with the testing framework of Cucumber (specifically using _nodejs_ with _cucumberjs_). They could either stay with what they had but were unhappy with, or migrate to the new framework in Gauge and rewrite most of their tests.

They decided to do the latter because, according to them:  `[..] we couldn’t live with the fact that change may never happen.`

As the two tools generally are structured in the same way, 

Whether or not it was worth it for them is a question they can answer themselves:

>**Was it worth it for us?**  
Absolutely worth it.
